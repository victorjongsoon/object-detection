# Object Detection
 In this self explanatory project, I would like to build an object detector using OpenCV.
 
# Making use of pre-trained model (MobileNet-SSD v3)
The model is downloaded from (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API).

# Example of Outputs

# What can be improved in this project?
1. Improve the accuracy of the pre-trained models
2. Try different pre-trained model (e.g. Faster-RCNN ResNet-50, Faster-RCNN Inception v2 etc.)

# Skillset required for the project (Deep Learning)
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV etc.)
* Pre-trained models
